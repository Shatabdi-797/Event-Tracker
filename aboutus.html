 <pre>
 We have many kinds of technical and cultural events in college. Though emails are already used to send to the students, but in some cases they may not keep track of registration time and thereby missed the chance to participate.
 Hence, this event management website will help them to have neat schedule of the events with respective due time, also notifications for the same. In addition to this, edits of events will be allowed to admins of events.
 Basically you can use it as participant or admin or both.
